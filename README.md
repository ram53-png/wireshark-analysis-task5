# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic using Wireshark

## Objective
To capture live network traffic using Wireshark, identify different protocols, and analyze packet-level communication.

---

## Tools Used
- **Tool:** Wireshark
- **System:** Windows 11 (x64)
- **Traffic Generated by:** Website visits, software updates, pings etc... 

---

## Steps Performed

1. Installed Wireshark and selected the active Wi-Fi interface
2. Started live capture
3. Opened websites and used tools like ping to generate traffic
4. Stopped capture after ~1 minute
5. Used filters like `dns`, `tcp`, and `http` to analyze traffic
6. Exported the capture as `.pcapng` file

---

## Protocols Identified

| Protocol | Source IP | Destination IP | Description |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| DNS | fe80::52c8:b84d:4c12:8df | fe80::1 | Standard query for resolving domains (e.g., `google.com`) |
| TCP | 192.168.1.8 | 54.145.204.93, others | TCP handshakes and acknowledgments for secure communication |
| HTTP | 2401:4900:8fce:a474... | 2a04:4e42:8e::684 | GET requests for files like `connecttest.txt`, Microsoft update files |

---

## Deliverables

- `Task 5 capture.pcapng` (exported file)
---

## Learnings

- Understood how DNS resolves domain names before a website loads
- Learned that TCP is the backbone of reliable data transfer
- Observed HTTP GET requests fetching resources from the web
- Got hands-on experience analyzing packets in Wireshark

---

## Notes

- Avoid capturing sensitive personal data during live capture
- Filters like `http`, `dns`, `tcp` in Wireshark make analysis faster
- Exporting `.pcapng` allows later review or submission
